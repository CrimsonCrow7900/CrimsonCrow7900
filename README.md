I like to read, write, draw, and ride my bike. 
I play basketball. 
I play many instruments. 
I love nature, music and the mountains. 
I just want to learn simple coding in computer science this year because to be honest, learning to code is not really one of my prorities. 
I guess I could get a good job if I learn computer science.
